The issue arises when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive within a plugin, specifically when the plugin is importing or extending another plugin that also utilizes `@apply`.  The problem manifests as unexpected CSS output, where some `@apply` directives are ignored or applied incorrectly. This often occurs when the `@apply` directive targets utility classes from the base Tailwind configuration, extended plugins, or other parts of the project's styles.  The incorrect application of `@apply` in a nested plugin scenario can lead to inconsistent styling and visual bugs throughout the application. Example: In pluginA.js, `@apply bg-gray-200 p-4` is used, but in pluginB.js, where pluginA is imported and used within another `@apply` directive, the `bg-gray-200` and `p-4` might be ignored.

```javascript
// pluginA.js
module.exports = function ({ addUtilities }) {
  addUtilities({
    '.my-utility': {
      '@apply': 'bg-gray-200 p-4'
    }
  })
}

// pluginB.js
module.exports = function ({ addUtilities }) {
  addUtilities({
    '.another-utility': {
      '@apply': 'text-lg my-utility' // my-utility from pluginA not applying correctly
    }
  })
}
```
